This implies that firms in \\nthe industry must constantly seek time and cost reductions through the efficient \\nuse of resources and technologies in order to maintain profitability while deliver -\\ning a quality of service at the level demanded by customers. A core function in \\nthe aviation sector is airport ground handling, a series of activities that play a pri-\\nmary role in flight schedule compliance and asset management efficiency. Which \\nin turn means that resource assignments in personnel, equipment and inputs are \\nall key elements in ensuring ground operations are carried out efficiently and \\neffectively.\\nIn this light, optimizing ground handling processes and improving ground \\ncrew working conditions is fundamental, especially at large international airports \\nwhere high traffic volumes render these operations all the more complex. The pre-\\nsent article is based on the real case of ground handling at Santiago International \\nAirport in Chile as it was shortly before the separate operations of LAN Airlines \\nand TAM Linhas Aereas were fully integrated following their merger as LATAM. \\nPart of a larger project undertaken during 2013–2015 to improve all aspects of \\nground operations at the airport, this study focused on two main goals: first, \\nthe development of a simulation model for the baggage loading area that would \\ndefine operating and response protocols for baggage handling incidents (Cavada \\net\\xa0al. 2017), and second, the development and computer-based implementation of \\nan optimization model to handle personnel planning for all ground crew. It is the \\nwork on the latter goal that will concern us here.\\nPersonnel planning is a critical task for ground handling operators, due not just \\nto its very significant impact on cost structures but also the scarcity of qualified \\nworkers given the considerable flight experience they must accumulate to obtain \\nthe necessary certifications. Furthermore, not always having the right personnel \\non duty as contractually required can lead to heavy fines that would turn labor \\ncosts into a major burden. Proper management of staff is thus of primary impor -\\ntance if operators are to be successful both operationally and financially in this \\nextremely competitive and fragile market.\\nThis paper reports on the implementation of an integer linear programming \\nmodel for the personnel planning of Santiago International Airport’s ground crew, \\nwhich consists of more than 800 workers employed in 22 different ground opera-\\ntion job categories. Associated with these categories is a range of qualifications, \\nskills and pre-existing work group assignments as well as employee-level restric-\\ntions relating to training, holidays, medical leave, assignable shifts as defined \\nunder employment agreements, etc. The problem to be solved by the model con-\\nsists in generating monthly shift assignments in the form of 28\\xa0day rosters for all \\noperating personnel that satisfy an array of legal, operational, human resource and \\nemployee welfare constraints as exemplified in Fig.\\xa01 .\\nSolving the problem presents a range of difficulties that stem not only from \\nits size but also the challenge of appropriately incorporating the complexities ', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Furthermore, it is crucial that \\nthe problem capture the ultimate objective of the rostering process, meaning that \\nthe objective function must be carefully specified. We opted to express it as a \\nweighted sum of staff assignment and welfare conditions indicators.\\nThe principal contribution of this article thus lies in the design of a mixed \\ninteger optimization model that, when used in conjunction with a state-of-the-\\nart commercial solver, can generate an exact solution of a real-world problem of \\nplanning the monthly rosters for a heterogeneous ground handling crew at an air -\\nport working under a 24/7 rotating shift system with multiple and diverse oper -\\national, welfare and human resources constraints reflecting the complexities in \\nthe operation. The global problem is broken down by job and explicitly includes \\nconditions relating to employee welfare. A remarkable feature of the model is its \\nflexibility, considering that a user of the tool could add new sequences agreed \\nbetween workers and company without touching the whole structure of the model.\\nThe model was implemented as part of a computer system known as ANDROS \\n(for “Andes Rostering System”) installed by the Santiago airport ground services \\noperator that allows the user to add and remove constraints to reflect prohibited \\nas well as required shifts in order, for example, to maximize the coverage of day \\nand shift personnel demand for an entire one-month planning period. Results will \\nbe presented for the implementation of the system used to generate the rosters, \\nwith special reference to the impact of the new rostering structure on the system’s \\noverall functioning since it replaced the former manual scheduling methods.\\nFig. 1  Constraint map for ground crew personnel planning problem', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Sections\\xa0 2 reviews the \\nrelated literature; Sect.\\xa0 3 introduces the problem, explaining various considerations \\nrelating to legal shift definitions, operating conditions and worker welfare criteria; \\nSect.\\xa0 4 develops the rostering model with its objective function and constraints; \\nSect.\\xa0 5 sets out the model results, compares them to those of the previously used \\nmanual rostering method and briefly discusses the model’s implementation in the \\nairport personnel planning system; and finally, Sect.\\xa05.3 summarizes and concludes.\\n2  Literature review\\nThe cost of labor in many industries, particularly for highly specialized operations, \\nhas meant that previous research has focused on improvements to rostering optimi-\\nzation models in which personnel is recognized as the main component of the total \\ncost structure (Ernst et\\xa0al. 2004; Burke et\\xa0al. 2004; Van den Bergh et\\xa0al. 2013). In \\nthis section, we first discuss previous works on scheduling of airport group opera-\\ntions, then we review some relevant rostering works in other industries and finally, \\nsome recent works incorporating fairness and welfare in the context of personnel \\nscheduling are presented.\\nIn the area of airport ground handling, several works are particularly worthy of \\nnote. In one of the first contributions in this area, Dowling\\xa0et al. (1997) provide a \\nformulation of the rostering problem in the context of airline ground-staff decided \\nmonthly, along with a simulated annealing method to solve a two-stage optimiza-\\ntion problem: the first stage decides monthly rosters while the second one allocates \\nspecific tasks on specific days to the staff assigned by the roster phase. Their system \\nwas able to solve a monthly roster for 500 staff in about 5\\xa0h. Soukour et\\xa0al. (2013) \\npresent a staff scheduling problem in airport security service solved in three steps: \\ndays-off scheduling, shift scheduling, and staff assignment. The authors propose a \\nmemetic algorithm combined with an evolutionary algorithm and local search tech-\\nniques to solve the staff assignment step. Kuo et\\xa0al. (2014) build an integer linear \\nprogramming model to handle customer service personnel planning at multiple \\nairports. Their staff scheduling problem can handle different skills requirements \\nthrough a multidimensional representation of them in the model and includes lunch \\nand rest breaks. They are able to solve their model for a real problem using proper \\nvalid inequalities, which is compared with a benchmark heuristic. Fahle et\\xa0al. (2016) \\nspecify and solve a cyclic roster planning problem, defined as the sequences of shifts \\ndesigned for a group of employees, who switch cyclically from one week to the next. \\nThen, in this scheme, several fairness aspects are considered in the construction; the \\nauthors present a local search post-processing step to obtain a fair cyclic plan with-\\nout altering the final cost of a non-cyclic optimal shift plan. Kutschka et\\xa0al. (2016) \\ndefine the monthly rostering problem including qualification constraints plus several \\nroster rules as well as fairness criteria; they use a branch-and-price (B&P) approach \\nwith temporal decomposition, solving the problem for seven instances where \\nemployees range from 130 to 304. Zeng et\\xa0al. (2019) consider hierarchical skills for \\na problem of ground personnel scheduling. In their setting, staff with higher level \\nskills is permitted to cover demands of lower levels (downgrading). They propose ', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='1 3A ground crew shift rostering model for\\xa0Santiago International…Page 5 of 26 20\\na B&P approach to solve the model. Shiau et\\xa0al. (2020) propose a hybrid personnel \\nscheduling model, which could be seen as an integrated rostering that include pre-\\nassignments and specific requests in the construction of individualized work lines \\nfor each employee, based on a fair and equal share principle satisfying specific qual-\\nity preferences associated with workload. For a given staff, the resulting scheduling \\nmeets demand while the cost of manpower is minimized. This model can also be \\nused as a simulation tool for decision making support.\\nPersonnel planning analysis frequently arises in the literature on crew schedul-\\ning and optimization models in other industries such as health and manufacturing. \\nBeliën et\\xa0 al. (2013) study the problem of building schedules of an aircraft main-\\ntenance company, based on an enumeration approach, in which shift patterns are \\nassigned using a mixed integer linear optimization model, solved for each combi-\\nnation of team sizes. Côté et\\xa0 al. (2013) use a B&P approach to assign shifts that \\nassumes heterogeneous employees executing multiple activities. The subproblems \\nare formulated using grammars and solved through dynamic programming; the B&P \\nalgorithms provided good-quality integer solutions for almost all tested instances. \\nBoyer et\\xa0al. (2014) solve a model using B&P with a heterogeneous work force and \\nvariable shift lengths. In this work, the employees have different qualifications, \\npreferences and availabilities. The subproblems are also formulated using gram-\\nmars to model the complex rules involved in the creation of feasible shifts for each \\nemployee. Restrepo et\\xa0al. (2015) propose a similar model to those discussed previ-\\nously (Côté et\\xa0 al. 2013; Boyer et\\xa0 al. 2014) to solve personalized tour scheduling \\nproblems in a multi-activity context assuming heterogeneous personnel. The prob-\\nlem is solved using a B&P approach based on two flexible enough formulations to \\nincorporate different start times, patterns, multiple breaks, among other conditions. \\nLapègue et\\xa0 al. (2013) present a model to build employee timetables to cover the \\ndemand associated with a set of tasks, which is based on constraint programming \\npursuing the optimality criterion of balancing the workload sharing in the context of \\na pharmaceutical firm. Wong et\\xa0al. (2014) design a two-stage heuristic algorithm to \\nschedule nurses at a Hong Kong hospital, which combines a shift assignment heuris-\\ntic with a sequential local search. Gérard et\\xa0al. (2016) develop a model that is solved \\nby column generation in a context with heterogeneous staff and highly variable work \\ndemand. Four heuristic methods are proposed to tackle the problem, providing good \\nquality solutions for real size instances in short time. Finally, a model due to Alp \\net\\xa0al. (2019) solves a real-world personnel scheduling problem, where the objective \\nis to assign the workers in a fair manner, satisfying weekly personnel demand with \\nthe best tours, and providing fair distribution among employees. The application \\nof the model in the company resulted in much better-quality schedules in terms of \\nfairness. \\nThe last decade has witnessed the incorporation of the heterogeneous person-\\nnel phenomenon in which a specific task can only be carried out by specific work -\\ners, and the idea of fairness or worker welfare is also increasingly being addressed. \\nThe recognition of this last notion varies from employer to employer and its inte-\\ngration into shift assignment techniques is, according to\\xa0 Wolbeck et\\xa0 al. (2019), a \\nwork in progress. A number of examples can be cited. Stockwell-Alpert et\\xa0al.

Gross et\\xa0al. (2018) propose two models to \\nschedule hospital physicians and operating rooms that include fairness and doctors’ \\npreferences. Breugem et\\xa0 al. (2019) find crew rostering solutions for a Dutch rail-\\nway company that consider fairness in workloads and shift structures using a three-\\nphase heuristic based on a neighborhood search algorithm. Finally, there is Rea et\\xa0al. \\n(2021), who analyze equality and fairness concepts in shift assignments and propose \\na number of techniques for their incorporation.\\nAlthough the research on personnel scheduling is extensive, we were unable to \\nfind works addressing in an integrated way all the features present in our specific \\nrostering problem. Namely: (i) personalized shift assignment scheme; (ii) preferred \\nbut not fixed working groups; (iii) existence of understaffing (personnel shortfall) \\nand overstaffing during certain periods; (iv) heterogeneous workforce and skill \\nrequirements; (v) temporary position upgrades and substitutions; (vi) fairness and \\nwelfare considerations.

The way in which we integrate these concepts in our model is a valuable con-\\ntribution of the present work.\\nNext, we describe the practical problem and develop a solution approach based \\non the solution of a series of mixed-integer programming models that adequately \\ncapture the particularities of the different configurations observed in the real-set-\\ntings of the case study.\\n3  Description of\\xa0the\\xa0problem\\nBefore the implementation in 2013 of the ANDROS rostering system and the \\nmodel presented here, the ground handling services operator (Andes Airport Ser -\\nvices S.A., a private firm hereafter denoted “the operator” or “the company”) drew \\nup the rosters assigning employees to shifts using manual methods, a process that \\nrequired excessive amounts of staff time and effort. The problem as it was at that \\ntime involved assigning the shifts for an entire month and for all operating person-\\nnel, taking into account legal requirements and operating conditions such as person-\\nnel demand for each job, demand for personnel with given skills, pre-existing work \\ngroups, special requests, and holidays and training sessions, as well as quantifiable \\nemployee welfare considerations.\\nAn important aspect of ground operations is that certain activities are performed \\non the airport apron and thus require tight coordination of personnel with different \\njobs and skills so that they are always available when needed. This involves a range \\nof factors and conditions that must be treated simultaneously, as in the three ground \\nservices illustrated in Fig.\\xa0 2. The right-hand side of the figure shows the case of \\napron services for a flight, which just for the flight group requires rostering a group \\nleader, two handlers, a conveyor and a cargo loader. These considerations, which are \\nplanned as a function of daily and monthly flight schedules, must be incorporated \\ninto the monthly rostering for each job as indicated in the figure.\\nThe optimization problem addressed by the model to be introduced in Sect.\\xa0 4 was \\nbuilt around three classes of interrelated constraints on the ground handling opera-\\ntions illustrated in Fig.\\xa0 1 that must be reflected in the rostering. As described in turn \\nbelow, the three classes are: shift structure and related legal considerations, operat-\\ning conditions, and employee welfare conditions.\\n(a) Shift structure and related legal considerations\\nShifts are defined in terms of the activity assigned to an employee for each day \\non the roster. There are three such activities: a work shift, on which an employee \\ncarries out his or her normal duties in the workplace; a non-work shift, on which an \\nemployee is attending training sessions or on medical leave and thus not available \\nfor work but is paid; and an off shift, referring to “free” days on which the employee \\nis neither at work, in training or on medical leave.', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

The Code also prohibits employees from \\nworking more than 6 consecutive days and further requires that two of the weekly \\ndays off in a month be Sundays. Working days for the ground crew employees are \\ndefined by three shift types: morning (M), from 4 am to 12 noon; afternoon (A), \\nfrom 12 noon to 8\\xa0pm; and night (N), from 8\\xa0pm to 12 midnight. After working any \\nsequence of night shifts, an employee is assigned a recovery day (R) before an off  \\nshift (O), the former being paid but not worked as explained above.

Personnel requirements. There are 22 different jobs that must be planned for the \\ncomplete set of ground handling operations. The company’s Capacity Planning \\nArea makes estimates of the number of workers required for each shift over the \\nmonth in each job, and since the ideal personnel solution cannot always be satis-\\nfied, it also estimates a “critical” or minimal requirement to be satisfied by each \\nshift wherever possible.\\n2. Work groups. Although most jobs are independent of each other, some are organ-\\nized in groups. For example, the team in charge of baggage is composed of a \\ngroup leader, a cargo loader/driver and various baggage handlers (Fig.\\xa0 2). The \\nmethodology considers the fact that, if possible, we intend to match the work \\ngroup assignments in a pre-process, in such a way that the model privileges the \\nformation of pre-assigned groups of workers that normally work together in jobs \\nthat require a team of employees with different skills and responsibilities to be \\nexecuted.\\n3. Specific skills. Workers doing the same job are not homogeneous. They may differ \\nas regards specific qualifications (e.g., certified for work on wide-body aircraft), \\npermits to work with certain airlines, or simply levels of experience. All of these \\nattributes will be included here under the heading of skills. The Capacity Planning \\nArea’s personnel estimates for each job on each shift specify the required number \\nof workers with each skill.\\n4. Non-productive days worked. Workers frequently have shifts in which they do \\nnot carry out any duties, yet they are considered to have worked those shifts even \\nthough they have not contributed to satisfying personnel demand. This most com-\\nmonly occurs when a worker: (a) must attend training sessions during working \\nhours; (b) is on medical leave; or (c) is on holiday.\\n(c) Employee welfare conditions\\nGround handling activities are considered to be heavy work. It is therefore in \\nthe interest of the company to incorporate certain welfare criteria into the roster -\\ning, which in concrete terms means that rosters should reflect a fair and appro-\\npriate distribution of workloads across personnel. The following objective and \\nmeasurable criteria for regulating workloads were thus agreed with the compa-\\nny’s Human Resources Area:\\n1. Rolling week. In any seven-day sequence there must be at least 2 days off, not \\nnecessarily consecutive. By contrast, the Labor Code stipulates that there must \\nbe 2 days off in each calendar week (Monday through Sunday).\\n2. Consecutive days off. Although as noted in the previous point, the 2 days off in \\nany 7 days need not be consecutive, in the interest of employee welfare they must \\nin fact be consecutive at least twice in a month.', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' J.\\xa0P .\\xa0Cavada et al.\\n1 3 20 Page 10 of 26\\n3. Fair shift distribution. To ensure the workload is distributed across employees \\nin the same job as fairly as possible, the number of shifts of each type (M, A, N) \\nassigned to each employee should be similar.\\n4. Shift breaks. Over a series of days worked, shift rotations can only go in the for -\\nward direction. These rotations are known as shift breaks, and although permitted, \\nare somewhat undesirable. They are shown as dashed lines in Fig.\\xa0 3.\\n5. Special shift sequences. Certain combinations of shifts are obligatory or prohib-\\nited, mainly because of legal provisions or employment agreements.\\nThe next section specifies in detail the mixed integer linear optimization model \\ndeveloped to define the monthly rosters while satisfying the various constraints just \\ndescribed above.\\n4  Mixed integer linear optimization model\\nAs explained in the previous section, the optimization model considers person-\\nnel demand (for homogeneous workers as well as those with particular skills), \\ntheir special requirements, legal considerations and operating conditions (train-\\ning sessions, holidays, medical leave, etc.) and employee welfare.

For example, a group leader, who oversees the flight group \\n(as the example shown in Figure\\xa0 2), is a critical job, therefore a shortfall for that job \\nis in fact not possible. Different is the case of a handler that works together with \\nother two workers in the same flight group, having more slack to react if a short-\\nfall is observed.

To address this issue, first the leader job \\nis solved, and then when solving the other jobs, for each employee e in a work group \\nthe variable yedt is set to 1 if the leader has also been assigned to this shift.\\nTo achieve good results, adequate border conditions must be provided to the \\nmodel. When solving the model, the planning horizons used for any given month \\ninclude two extra weeks: one week before and one week after the analyzed month. \\nThe set D− represents the group of days already set before the current month and \\ntheir corresponding variables are fixed as a border condition. The extra week after \\nthe month is used to avoid myopic solutions that could make it\\xa0difficult to get the \\nsolution on future scenarios.\\n5  Implementation and\\xa0results\\nThis section presents the results of the operator’s implementation of the rostering \\nmodel developed in the previous section. We begin as in a case study by making \\ndirect comparisons between the solutions generated by the model and those drawn \\nup manually by company planners, thus revealing the model’s ability to generate \\nbenefits. This is followed by a description of the implementation at the airport and \\nthe computational difficulties that were encountered. Finally, we discuss the qualita-\\ntive impact of the implementation on the complete roster generation process in the \\npersonnel department and other related departments of the company.\\n5.1  Case study: comparison with\\xa0previous manual scheduling\\nThree factors shaped the before-and-after performance analysis carried out to com-\\npare the roster solutions generated by the model with those drawn up under the pre-\\nvious manual techniques.\\n i. The operating conditions at the airport change considerably from month to \\nmonth, so comparisons based on consecutive months, or even the same month \\nin different years, may not constitute a valid test. As a result, we compared \\nindicators relating to the manual and model-generated solutions for the same \\nmonth.\\n ii. The company’s rostering is subject to frequent revisions and last-minute adjust-\\nments, any of which may impact one or more performance indicators. We there-\\nfore compared the model-generated roster to the initial manual roster drawn up \\nbefore any revisions or adjustments were made.', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

The actual implementation of the models by the company was carried out \\ngradually. The rosters designed during this transition period thus do not faith-\\nfully reflect the results of either the manual methods or the models.\\nIn light of the foregoing, we inputted the data used in drawing up the last manu-\\nally produced roster to our models and on that basis generated rosters for three criti-\\ncal jobs. These rosters were then compared to those for the corresponding manual \\nsolutions before revisions or adjustments (details in Table\\xa06 below).\\nThe first result of note is that unlike the manual methods, the model was able to \\nfind rosters that complied with all labor and employment agreement conditions for \\nall personnel. Special requests (medical leave, specific shift requests, training ses-\\nsions, etc.) were also covered by the model in almost every case, a considerably bet-\\nter result than for the manual methods. Indicators (3) and (4) in Table\\xa0 6 reveal that \\nthe model generated more efficient personnel assignments. The reduction in days off  \\nwas compensated by assignments that ensured every worker’s 2 days off per 7\\xa0day \\nsequence were consecutive at least once a month. An employee is considered to have \\na fair schedule if the number of shifts of each type t falls inside the interval [/u1D707−\\net , /u1D707+\\net] . \\nIndicator (6) in Table\\xa0 6 shows that the model increased the percentage of employees \\nwith only fair shifts obtained under the manual system by 16 percentage points.\\nTurning to operating indicators, the model cut the number of extra shifts that had \\nto be assigned by 8 percentage points, an improvement whose impact was all the \\nmore significant given that most of the reduction was felt on Sundays when days off  \\nare most appreciated. As regards job coverage (i.e., demand versus assigned), with \\nthe model the percentage increased for all three job categories tested. This result \\nwas particularly notable in the case of ramp agents given that wherever possible they \\nmust be scheduled for the same shifts as their crew chiefs, thus considerably reduc-\\ning their shift assignment flexibility.\\nIn general terms, then, the model improved significantly on the results of the \\nmanual methods. In what follows we discuss the implementation of the model and \\nsome results obtained during the first months of its application.Table 6  Comparison of manual \\nand model-generated schedulesKPI (April 2013) Manual Model\\n(1) % of non-compliant schedules 3% 0%\\n(2) Special request satisfaction 84%  > 99%\\n(3) Average days off per employee 9.8 9.62\\n(4) Average % of personnel assigned daily 62.7% 64.3%\\n(5) Employees assigned no consecutive days off 7% 0%\\n(6) Fair schedules 55% 71%\\n(7) Employees assigned extra shifts 62% 54%\\n(8) Job coverage (no. of employees)\\nGroup leader (60) 86% 91%\\nRamp handler (150) 82% 83%\\nAircraft tow driver (31) 94% 98%', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

Any additional requirements or constraints can be coded \\nand introduced into the platform by the planners (see Fig.\\xa04).\\nThe construction of the rosters is executed by the AndrosCore subsystem. Devel-\\noped in Java, its principal components are Data Origin, which processes and vali-\\ndates the input parameters; MIPMODEL, where the models are implemented in \\nGLPK; and the Gurobi® optimization solver. The decision to implement the models \\nseparately from the solver was made by the company. In the original setup, Andro-\\nsCore was installed on an Intel i7-3770\\xa0K 3.5\\xa0GHz processor with 16\\xa0GB of RAM.\\nA flowchart illustrating the AndrosCore rostering procedure is presented in \\nFig.\\xa0 5. For each job the procedure starts by reading the related data (staffing level, \\ndemand, requests, etc.) and then retrieves the personnel requirements according to \\nshift start time, which are therefore grouped at this stage by shift type (M, A, N). \\nFor employees with special requests (vacations, courses, medical leaves, etc.) their \\ncorresponding shifts are preset. Next, the procedure reads the optimization param-\\neters (solver time limit, optimality gap target and objective function weights) that \\nhave been parameterized for each job. Before solving the model, a relaxed feasibility \\nversion is built and used to determine whether or not a feasible solution exists (see \\nFig. 4  ANDROS platform architecture\\nFig. 5  AndrosCore rostering procedure', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

If a feasible solution does not exist, a report on possible \\nproblems is generated to support the planner’s ultimate decision and the procedure \\nmoves on to the next job (see under next heading). If, on the other hand, there is a \\nsolution, the model is executed, an algorithm assigns the shift start time and the pro-\\ncedure concludes on the job with the generation of a report.\\nThe order in which the different jobs are executed in the AndrosCore rostering \\nprocedure in Fig.\\xa0 5 is explained in previous Sect.\\xa0 4 part g) where the details of the \\nexecution of the model are highlighted.\\n5.3  Feasibility model\\nIn cases where no feasible solution exists it may be difficult to identify the reasons, \\nespecially if the cause is the interaction of two or more constraints. To facilitate the \\nplanner’s task, a modified version of the model checks each constraint individually \\nand every combination known to produce frequent conflicts, and delivers a report on \\nthe findings. The usual conditions that can lead to an infeasible model are:\\n(a) Previous month border conditions, infeasibilities occur when a preset shift con-\\nflicts with the last week of the previous month.\\n(b) Preset shifts, corresponding to special shifts requests are the most common \\nsource of infeasibilities. It can be because a conflicting request (e.g., an employee \\nwith a course set that also received a medical leave for the same period) or \\nbecause a request leaves a shift without enough staff to operate.\\n(c) Workgroup assignments, similar to case b) regarding preset shifts, employees \\nthat belong to a workgroup are preassigned to the same shifts that their group \\nleader; if such assignment is not possible (by a special shift request for example) \\nthe model would become infeasible.\\n(d) Minimum staffing and skills requirements, shown by constraints (9)-(11). While \\nthese are a very common reason for infeasibility, they result normally as a con-\\nsequence of other conflicts. Therefore, we check this condition last.\\nThe first step is to search for an initial feasible solution of the complete problem. \\nIf the problem fails to find such a solution, then for each of the previous conditions \\na unique feasibility model is solved. This model consists of relaxing the problem-\\natic constraint by adding a slack variable to it and minimizing the sum of all slack \\nvariables.\\nTo identify all infeasible conditions, first the relaxed model is solved for each \\nset of problematic constraints independently. If none of these problems lead to an \\ninfeasible solution in the relaxed model, then the cause must be in the interaction \\nof two or more constraints. In that case, new models are built, systematically testing \\nfor conditions in pairs (ex.: special shift requests plus workgroups). Finally, all posi-\\ntive slack variables are reported to the planner so he/she can address the problem as \\nneeded.', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

Note that finding an optimal solution is not a \\npriority given that the rosters will be tweaked manually before being published in \\nfinal form in order to accommodate last-minute changes.\\nTo estimate a job’s computational complexity, two factors were taken into \\naccount: the staffing level and the ratio of shift supply to shift demand (both in num-\\nber of shifts), denoted u . The first factor is obtained by multiplying the staffing level \\nby the number of shifts hired (e.g., 20 employees by 5 weekdays) and then subtract-\\ning holidays, medical leave and training sessions. The result is the upper bound on \\nthe coverage that can be achieved.\\nA real example of the results of a model run for 18 jobs is summarized in Table\\xa0 7. \\nAs regards the column headings, “supply” indicates the number of shifts available \\nif all personnel were available; “H.L.T.” is the sum of holidays, medical leave and \\ntraining sessions; “net supply” is the difference between the two; and u is the upper \\nbound on coverage.\\nThe “Time” column presents time in seconds needed to reach the target gap and \\nthose marked by an asterisk (*) are the cases where the time limit TL was reached \\nbefore getting the target gap.\\nAn interesting result revealed in this table is that even for cases where u<1 , the \\ncoverage level is still very close to that upper limit. As observed in the Table\\xa0 7, the \\nmain factor that is preponderant in adding complexity to the solution of the model \\nis the understaffing; the less employees are present in a shift, the more difficult the \\nmodel becomes to be solved, in both time and quality of solution. The second factor \\nthat is observed relevant in increasing the complexity of the solution of the model \\nis the number of employees of the job, which means that the model applied to jobs \\nwith a larger volume of manpower requires more computational time to obtain a \\ngood-quality integer solution than other jobs with just few employees required. Note \\nthat in some instances the actual coverage reaches the upper bound on coverage, in \\nwhich case the model can be stopped early even though the gap obtained is not good \\nenough (e.g., shift leader). Overall, the model obtains consistently good coverages \\ngiven the observed availability of employees in most of the real instances.\\nOnce the optimization of the rosters is complete, the results may be outputted in \\nthe form of a spreadsheet for consultation and possible tweaking by planners and \\ndistributed to other company areas and departments. This report will also include \\nall of the operating and welfare indicators. An example of such output is given in \\nFig.\\xa06.\\nIn the report shown in the figure, the description in A) identifies the name of \\nthe job, its code, date and number of employees to be scheduled. Below left in sec-\\ntor A) a detail in the rows of the IDs and names of the employees is also deployed. \\nSection C) describes the different shifts assigned to each employee over the entire ', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

How the model responds to a job staffing shortfall is illustrated \\nin sector B) of the spreadsheet: the upper table shows the required staffing for the \\nthree shifts (Morning, Afternoon and Night) and the assignment of the model is in \\nthe lower table. In this instance, the quantity of scheduled H.L.T. implies a maxi-\\nmum coverage of u=1.0 but the model does not attain that level. It does, however, \\nequalize absences in order that no shift be left uncovered. The fact that all night \\nshifts are covered is due to a constraint applied to that job.

A flowchart of the pro-\\ncess before implementation is given in Fig.\\xa0 7. As can be seen, the process lasts four \\nweeks and is fed by four inputs. The main input is the personnel demand estimates \\nfor each job drawn up by the Capacity Planning Area based on the airlines’ flight \\nschedules and historical data. The planners then use this information to construct the \\nrosters, starting with those that show the least variance. Meanwhile, other company \\nareas have until the third week to submit any special requests, which are incorpo-\\nrated into the rosters as they are received. In the fourth week, the Capacity Planning \\nArea finalizes the requests, leaving a few days for the planners to review the rosters \\nand publish the definitive versions.\\nTo arrive at a satisfactory implementation of ANDROS, all human resource and \\ntraining staff had to shorten the deadlines for submitting new personnel requests. \\nSince the roster construction period was curtailed, the time allowed for estimating \\npersonnel demand was extended, particularly for the more complex jobs, so the pre-\\ndictions would be as accurate as possible. Although under these arrangements the \\nplanners have less than two weeks to put together the rosters, the real execution time \\nfor the models is about 48\\xa0h, leaving the remaining days for reviewing the results, \\nresolving schedule conflicts and identifying possible data errors. In the end this \\nproved to flexibilize the whole process, leaving enough time to make any manual \\nFig. 8  Ground handling personnel planning and rostering process after implementation of ANDROS', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

The new set of proce-\\ndures is flowcharted in Fig.\\xa08.\\n6  Discussion and\\xa0conclusions\\nGround operations are a key set of tasks in the proper functioning of a large airport. \\nGiven the relatively high cost of qualified personnel and the growing use of sophisti-\\ncated technology, ground operation personnel planning must be carried out in a rig-\\norous and efficient manner. The specialized qualifications required by ground crews \\nmean that understaffing is always a potential problem, so minimizing understaffing \\nis a central objective. In addition, there are a series of conditions and restrictions \\nthat must be met, some of which are legal or operational in nature while others relate \\nto worker welfare or quality of life and in many cases are enshrined in employment \\ncontracts.\\nThis study presented a mixed integer linear programming model to design shift \\nrosters for heterogeneous ground operation workers that solve the personnel plan-\\nning problem as it arises at Santiago International Airport in Chile. The model \\naddresses employee demand per day and shift and worker welfare criteria, and \\nallows the user to add constraints specifying obligatory and prohibited shift patterns \\nthat reflect changes over time in employment contract provisions and operating con-\\nditions. Thus, the model involves many complexities in the operation formulated \\nand solved considering welfare, operational and human resources constraints in a \\nflexible scheme useful for further applications.\\nRegarding the constraints associated with special shift sequences, the compat-\\nibility between shifts was considered in the model through special sequences, in \\nthe way it was explained in Sect.\\xa0 4, subsection f). As discussed there, the use of \\nsuch sequences as part of the model facilitates the planner´s task of incorporating \\nnew conditions without changing the model. Then, in case the union reaches new \\nlabor agreements with the company, the planner can add the new sequences agreed \\nbetween workers and company without touching the whole structure of the model, \\nand that is a major feature and novelty of this formulation that adds flexibility to the \\nsystem.\\nOnce gradual implementation of the model at the airport was completed in June \\n2013, solutions were generated for all ground operation jobs using the Gurobi® \\nsolver. The result was an improvement in job coverage averaging 3% over the \\nsolutions drawn up using the former manual methods, without any deterioration \\nin worker welfare conditions such as fair shift assignments or the number of shift \\nbreaks. Use of the model also brought about a reduction in the amount of time \\ndevoted to roster design. It should further be noted that the solver solutions were \\nexact without resorting to heuristics.\\nAcknowledgements The authors want to acknowledge the support of project ANID/FONDECYT/REG-\\nULAR 1191200 and the Complex Engineering Systems Institute ANID PIA/PUENTE AFB220003.', metadata={'source': 'paper_shift_scl.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",
